# AQUAID ‚Äì Water Scarcity Prediction and Alert System üö∞

## üß© Problem Statement

Water scarcity affects billions worldwide, especially in urban regions and areas with seasonal rainfall fluctuations. Current water management systems are **reactive**, informing users only **after** a shortage occurs‚Äîby then, it‚Äôs often too late for citizens or municipal bodies to act meaningfully.

Residents typically discover a water crisis only when taps run dry, leading to distress, health risks, and resource mismanagement. Municipal authorities lack reliable, **hyperlocal forecasts** to prepare or intervene in advance.

There is an urgent need for a **real-time, proactive water prediction and alert system** to help individuals and authorities **respond ahead of time**.

---

## üí° Approach & Solution

**AQUAID** is an **AI-powered web platform** that predicts **localized water scarcity** 2‚Äì4 weeks in advance by analyzing:

- Weather data (temperature, rainfall forecasts)
- Civic water supply schedules
- Historical consumption trends
- Crowd-sourced user reports

The system generates **alerts, micro-actions**, and **data visualizations** to help both citizens and municipal bodies conserve water and plan interventions.
